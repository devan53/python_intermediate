"Very good product at the price point","Its working good. Heats up in a minor way, but overall the product quality is very good. More so, compared to the 10K price of the original adapter. I am not promoting use on non-genuine apple parts. But, a 3 year old laptop, whihc wont sell for more than 25K; investing 10K into a new charger is a bit too much to ask. eh! **Also urging all users/buyers to please take out the time and write a product review without fail. It only takes a minute. It is us, consumers, who get greatly benefited from these reviews. N.B.* I am not associated with the dealer in any way. Just a happy consumer.","31 Jul 2018","Style name: 60W MG1 - MB Pro 13""","","Yes","Swagat Bose","5.0","Artis AR-60W-MG1 60 Watts Laptop Adapter/Charger for MB Pro 13”/MacBook Unibody (16.5V, 3.65A) (L-Tip Connector)","https://www.amazon.in/Artis-AR-MAC-60W-MG1-100-240V-Adapter-Macbook/product-reviews/B017LP6R62/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews"

"Cost effective replacement charger ...","I have been using it for now about 2 weeks ... Works fine with macbook pro. Does NOT heat up excessively like other chargers i tried earlier. No complaints so far.. If the status changes i would update the review accordingly.. It's cost effective(1600/-) replacement charger worth a try , instead of shelling out 7800/- for the  company one ... i tried 2 other company chargers ( which were heating up so badly ) ... Atleast with this one that's not the case.","08 Apr 2018","Style name: 60W MG1 - MB Pro 13""","","Yes","Pranav","4.0","Artis AR-60W-MG1 60 Watts Laptop Adapter/Charger for MB Pro 13”/MacBook Unibody (16.5V, 3.65A) (L-Tip Connector)","https://www.amazon.in/Artis-AR-MAC-60W-MG1-100-240V-Adapter-Macbook/product-reviews/B017LP6R62/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews"
"Hit or miss product","This seems like a hit or miss product, with luck playing a huge role. My charger worked great for 2-3 weeks then it would only come on when I placed the wire in a particular way and by the end of 2 months only when I placed it in one particular way with weight on top of it. Now it doesn't come on at all. Can't figure out how to get it replaced with the warranty and they don't seem to have a store in Delhi. I had to buy the original for Rs. 7500 and regret why I didn't just buy the original in the first place.","07 May 2019","Style name: 60W MG1 - MB Pro 13""","","Yes","M {square}","1.0","Artis AR-60W-MG1 60 Watts Laptop Adapter/Charger for MB Pro 13”/MacBook Unibody (16.5V, 3.65A) (L-Tip Connector)","https://www.amazon.in/Artis-AR-MAC-60W-MG1-100-240V-Adapter-Macbook/product-reviews/B017LP6R62/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews"

"Don't waste your money","I ordered Artis 60 W charger and it was delivered before time. But before the delivery boy left my house I checked and it was not working. I ordered for refund and then again re-ordered after a couple of days. The new charger was working and the green and orange lights were also functioning. In about 10-12 days the charger stopped charging. There was issue of heating and sparking. It even damaged the charging area of my laptop. They have mentioned that there is no warranty if the charger tip is burnt. So in short I wasted my money and also time.","15 May 2019","Style name: 60W MG1 - MB Pro 13""","","Yes","RSB","1.0","Artis AR-60W-MG1 60 Watts Laptop Adapter/Charger for MB Pro 13”/MacBook Unibody (16.5V, 3.65A) (L-Tip Connector)","https://www.amazon.in/Artis-AR-MAC-60W-MG1-100-240V-Adapter-Macbook/product-reviews/B017LP6R62/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews"
"Worst Charger","I am a coder so i don't want to miss my work or else i'll be far behind. I purchased a macbook air charger from the market and it lasted 6 months and talking about this charger, i have attached 2 pics of the charger it's been only 1 month since i started using this and you can clearly see in the pic that charger pin has penetrated inside the charger and charger's light is on even i plugged it out. Worst product, now i'm not left with any option, if send this charger to the seller then it will take days going to them and returning to me, Don't go with this product i have recently bought it and i am already regretting....:(","16 Oct 2019","Style name: 45W MG2 - MB Air 11""/13""","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61FDi7jDg-L._SY88.jpg

"Blew up on us!","This is the second one we've purchased for our Apple MacBook Pro.  It's appealing because of the price.  A real Apple product cost about 6 times more.  So the first time we bought this product, it lasted for three months.  We thought, oh, well, maybe it was a fluke!  So we bought another one.  It lasted 2 weeks then literally blew up inside.  All the electrical wires fried!  Moral of the story?  Stick to real Apple products if you want quality.  We have since bought an Apple charger for the MacBook.  Don't purchase this, besides not working for very long, it is dangerous!","11 Jan 2020","Style name: 60W MG1 - MB Pro 13""","","Yes","Gayle Lawrence","1.0","Artis AR-60W-MG1 60 Watts Laptop Adapter/Charger for MB Pro 13”/MacBook Unibody (16.5V, 3.65A) (L-Tip Connector)","https://www.amazon.in/Artis-AR-MAC-60W-MG1-100-240V-Adapter-Macbook/product-reviews/B017LP6R62/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews"
"Best Alternative for Absurdly expensive Original Macbook pro charger","in Feb 2019 during a voltage fluctuation in my house, my original macbook pro charger went burst and there was sparks coming out of the adapter. Stumbled upon this charger on amazon as i wasn't going to spend bomb on buying the original charger for a 4-5 years old laptop. it works like original apple charger, yes there is a very slight heating on the jack but it's almost non noticeable. been using it very roughly still have not faced any issue. As you can see from the image it's BIS certified so should face no issue as product is marked safe. People looking for cheap and durable alternative for original apple charger go for it.","29 Jun 2019","Style name: 60W MG1 - MB Pro 13""","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Bkxkr6uML._SY88.jpg

"Bad product - contact tips burnt in 4 months","This adapter had issue with the earthing. I always had laptop connected to monitor to avoid shocks and vibration on the laptop case. Within 4 months contacts are burnt and it is no longer charging. Checked the warranty terms it specifically doesn't cover burnt magnetic tips. Looks like its a known issue and they are still selling the product.","19 Feb 2020","Style name: 45W MG2 - MB Air 11""/13""","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61XQdiowc4L._SY88.jpg
